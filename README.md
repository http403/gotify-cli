# Gotify-CLI in Docker

This repository uses GitHub action to package [`gotify/cli`](https://github.com/gotify/cli) into a Docker container. New packages will be published to Docker Hub when the upstream have new commits. However, release might be off as it might not be automated by current update process. For usage, please reference the [orginal documentation](https://github.com/gotify/cli/blob/master/README.md) to know how to use it.

## ⚠CAUTION⚠
I don't have a great record in maintaining packages. It might disappear sometime in the future because of many reasons. Please consider and don't too rely on this.
